GBMdiscovery is an R-based user-friendly tool that analyzes the publicly available RNA-seq datasets to find which genes and biological phenomena might be differentially regulated upon distinct levels of a specific gene. First, the app investigates each dataset individually, displaying both altered genes and processes. Then, GBMdiscovery compares the results to provide a list containing the genes that are commonly down or upregulated in a ubiquitous manner across all datasets. In addition, the platform calculates the correlation between the selected gene and the ones expressed by malignant cells of the scRNA-seq data. Therefore, GBMdiscovery facilitates the uncovering of potentially interesting genes that may contribute to GBM biology, ultimately leading to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets against the tumor.

For this app, we made available the top highly variable genes in each dataset.
